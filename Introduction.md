Hey there,

I'm Leon, and I’m just starting out on my coding journey! My current go 
to languages are C++ and Python, but I’m always excited to learn and explore more.

You’ll find some of my projects here—most of them might seem simple, but they’ve been real learning experiences for me
(and honestly, they’ve taken hours of figuring out!). For me, it’s all about understanding how the logic of coding languages works.

After leveling up my C++ and Python skills, I’m thinking of branching out to Java, JavaScript, 
or even web development to get a feel for how those worlds work.

I’ve always been into creating things—before coding, I was into digital art, working with Unity, 
and designing game maps. Now, coding feels like the perfect extension of that creative side.

Thanks a lot for stopping by and taking the time to check this out!

Best wishes,
Leon
